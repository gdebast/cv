## 2020 - 2024 : Operational Research Software Engineer, OM Partners, Belgium, Wavre.

In 2020, I became the responsible of the Solver module. My first decision was to organize the code with modern architecture principles. The code had to be encapsulated in components, the components could not have cyclic dependencies and the purpose of a component could not be shared. Those were the main rules which were translated into a style guide.

The other main achieve while being the responsible of this module, was to set up automatic testing on every public component. Automatic testing was never set up on this module. The productivity of the team increased as well as the quality of the product, as we could concentrate on the development rather than on solving bugs.

## 2016 - 2020 : Operational Research Consultant, OM Partners, Belgium, Antwerpen.

After three years in Paris, I came back to Belgium to encorporate the Operational Research team. This team is responsible for maintaining and installing the algorithms automating the planning decisions for our customers. During those years, I mainly maintained and customized the Mixed Integer Programming model of OM Partners.

## 2013 - 2016 : Supply Chain Consultant, OM Partners, France, Paris.
